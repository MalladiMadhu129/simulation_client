Absolutely, here's the README specifically tailored for the `simulation_client`:


# simulation_client

## Overview

The simulation_client is the frontend component of the Vehicle Simulation Dashboard application. It provides a user-friendly interface for visualizing and managing vehicle simulation scenarios. Key features include scenario and vehicle management, simulation control, and real-time visualization of vehicle movement.

## Installation

To install and run the simulation_client, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

3. Install dependencies by running the command:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

5. Start the client by running the command:

   npm start
   ```

6. Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access the simulation_client.

## Usage

1. Upon launching the simulation_client, you will be presented with the home page where you can select a scenario from the dropdown menu.

2. After selecting a scenario, you can view the list of vehicles associated with that scenario and perform actions such as editing or deleting vehicles.

3. Use the "Start Simulation" button to initiate the movement of vehicles within the selected scenario. Use the "Stop Simulation" button to pause the simulation.

4. The graph container displays a visual representation of vehicle movement, with vehicles represented as colored dots on a coordinate plane.

5. You can also add new scenarios and vehicles using the respective functionalities provided in the application.
